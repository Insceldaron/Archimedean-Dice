# Archimedean-Dice
Documentation for "Archimedean Dice", to be used in board game and TTRPG design.

## What is this project?
Archimedian Dice is my project devoted to designing, creating and hopefully popularising "Archimedian Dice" for use by Board Game and TTRPG (Tabletop Role-Play Game) designers. The basis of this project comes from my research project "The Properties and Probabilities of Archimedean Solids when used as Dice" taken as part of my A-Levels, so much of the initial work for it was from an academic perspective, and focused on the statistics and probability.
